# Personalized Least Fare Bus App using C++
 A personalized Least Fare Bus app using CPP, STL Library, Data Structures and Dijkstra's algorithm to make choosing cost effective bus routes easier.
 User has to input the available bus routes and the fares corresponding to those buses.
 User then has to input the desired start and destination stations.
 The program prints the most cost effective bus route for the user along with the fare required.
 ## *Bonus:
 If the user wants to avoid a particular bus route, there is an option of avoiding that and the app prints the next most cost effective path for the user.
 ## Requirements :
 The code can be copied and run on any device with a g++ or c++ compiler installed.
